# PRC-CMORL
This repo is the implementation of "**[Personalized Robotic Control via Constrained Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/375254025_Personalized_robotic_control_via_constrained_multi-objective_reinforcement_learning)**".




## Installation
This repo is developed using Python 3.7 and PyTorch 1.3.1+CPU in Ubuntu 16.04. 

We utilize the proposed CMORL approach to train the robotic agent in the popular [MuJoCo](https://mujoco.org/) (MuJoCo 2.0) platform.

We believe that our code can also run on other operating systems with different versions of Python, PyTorch and MuJoCo, but we have not verified it.

The required packages can be installed using

	pip install -r requirements.txt
